What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

At first it was confusing as to what the question was asking me. Utilizing the example we did in class worked for me, however making sure I included and ran everything that I needed to left me a little lost for this first assignment. Advice I would give to someone taking this course in the future is to go to office hours and pay attention to other people's questions as well as your own (don't be afraid to ask them).
